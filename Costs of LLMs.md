Training large language models (LLMs) involves substantial computational resources and financial investment. The costs have varied significantly across different models and over time:

- **GPT-3 (2020):** Training costs were estimated between $2 million and $4 million. citeturn0search2

- **PaLM (2022):** Google's PaLM model incurred training costs ranging from $3 million to $12 million. citeturn0search2

- **GPT-4 (2023):** Estimates suggest training costs around $20 million. citeturn0search3

- **DeepSeek-R1 (2025):** The Chinese startup DeepSeek developed the R1 model with a training cost of approximately $5.6 million, significantly lower than its predecessors. citeturn0news12

These figures illustrate the substantial investments required for developing advanced LLMs, though recent innovations have demonstrated potential for more cost-effective approaches.
