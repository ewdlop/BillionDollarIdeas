When discussing **database-optimized operating systems**, we’re usually referring to OS environments that are specifically tailored for running databases with high efficiency, reliability, and scalability. Some well-known options include:

### **1. Database-Optimized Operating Systems**
These OSes are either specialized for database workloads or have optimizations to enhance database performance.

#### **A. Linux-Based Optimizations**
Linux is the go-to OS for databases, with many optimizations for database workloads:
- **Oracle Linux** – Oracle’s optimized Linux version includes the **Unbreakable Enterprise Kernel** for better database performance.
- **Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) for Databases** – Supports large-memory databases like SAP HANA with optimizations for IO and NUMA.
- **SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES) for SAP HANA** – Optimized for SAP workloads with built-in database tuning.
- **Ubuntu Server with PostgreSQL/MySQL optimizations** – Canonical provides specific tweaks for database workloads.
- **Rocky Linux & AlmaLinux** – CentOS alternatives, often used in enterprise database environments.

#### **B. Purpose-Built OS for Databases**
- **Oracle Solaris** – Designed for Oracle DB with **ZFS, DTrace**, and **Zones** for performance and security.
- **IBM AIX** – Optimized for **IBM Db2** and high-performance workloads.
- **Microsoft Windows Server (SQL Server Edition)** – Tailored for SQL Server with features like **Resilient File System (ReFS)** and **Storage Spaces Direct**.

#### **C. Embedded Database OS**
- **QNX Neutrino** – Used in embedded systems with real-time database requirements.
- **VxWorks** – Optimized for embedded applications running lightweight databases.

### **2. Amazon OS (AWS Operating Systems)**
Amazon has developed multiple OS variants optimized for cloud computing and database workloads.

#### **A. AWS-Specific OS**
- **Amazon Linux** – A CentOS/RHEL-based OS optimized for AWS, used for general cloud workloads, including databases.
- **Bottlerocket OS** – A container-optimized Linux OS, useful for running databases inside containers.

#### **B. Database-Optimized AWS Services**
Instead of running an OS directly, AWS provides fully managed database solutions:
- **Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service)** – Runs MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, MariaDB, and Oracle with optimized OS environments.
- **Amazon Aurora** – A MySQL/PostgreSQL-compatible cloud-native database with an optimized OS-level stack.
- **Amazon Redshift** – A data warehouse service with OS optimizations for analytics.

#### **C. Custom Amazon OS for High-Performance Workloads**
- **Fire OS** – A modified Android-based OS for Amazon devices.
- **Nitro Hypervisor** – AWS’s hypervisor for running EC2 instances efficiently.
